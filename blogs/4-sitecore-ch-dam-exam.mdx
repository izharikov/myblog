## Intro

I recently passed the [Sitecore Content Hub Administrator Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/8000032c-309e-4dc3-a5f4-27da5ffac960/public_url) and want to share my experience — especially what areas of Content Hub you should focus on to prepare effectively.

There’s already plenty of information about what to expect and how to get ready, but this guide focuses on **what to explore hands-on in the Sandbox** to increase your chances of passing.

## Competencies and Preparation

The exam covers the following key competencies:

- Asset Management in Content Hub DAM  
- Content Hub DAM Configuration  
- Security & Rights Management for Content Hub DAM  
- State Flow Configuration with Content Hub  
- Content Creation & Management with CMP  
- Project Management with MRM

## Where to Start

Begin with the _Content Hub for Administrators_ e-learning course on [learning.sitecore.com](https://learning.sitecore.com/).  
Also, get access to a **sandbox** to explore the platform in practice.

To go beyond the basics and prepare for the exam, check the sections below.

## Asset Management in Content Hub DAM

### Entities (Schema)

Entities are the foundation of Content Hub, so explore them thoroughly. 

![Schema](/images/2025/ch/schema.png)

Create **custom fields** with different settings (conditional validation, field-level security, etc.) to see how they behave. 

![new member](/images/2025/ch/new-member.png)

Review the **Entity Details** pages for various types (Assets, Content, Projects) to understand how data and relations are structured. 
Learn which **repositories** are used by DAM, CMP, and MRM, and how they store and organize data.

![entity details - repository](/images/2025/ch/entity-details-repository.png)

Finally, understand the difference between **Option Lists** and **Taxonomies** — both categorize data but differ in search, filtering, and security inheritance.

![taxonomy vs option list](/images/2025/ch/taxnonomy-vs-option-list.png)

_Suggestion:_ Create a custom entity type, taxonomy, and option list. Add validation and security rules to practice configuration.

### Assets

Assets are a major part of the exam. Review all **asset statuses** in DAM, CMP, and MRM to understand the full lifecycle — from creation to approval and archiving.  

![asset actions](/images/2025/ch/asset-actions.png)

Check the **Project Incoming** page to see which assets appear there and why.
Study [**File Storage**](https://doc.sitecore.com/ch/en/users/content-hub/file-storage.html) and **export options** to learn how files, renditions, and metadata are managed.  
Understand the difference between **M.File** and **M.Asset**, how duplicates are handled, and how **hash values** are used (`entitymgmt => System` section).
Finally, review **asset type flags**, such as those enabling Azure Vision or ZIP extraction — these often appear in exam questions.

![asset type](/images/2025/ch/asset-type.png)

_Suggestion:_ Upload and export assets, import data from Excel, review statuses, and explore the Entity Details for assets and files.

## Content Creation & Management and State Flow with CMP

The **Content Marketing Platform (CMP)** focuses on content lifecycle — from idea to publication.
Start by exploring the **out-of-the-box (OOTB) state flows** provided by Sitecore. Observe each state and transition to understand how ideas become approved content.  

![state flow](/images/2025/ch/state-flow.png)

Then create your own **custom state flow**, noting restrictions when adding states, actions, or conditions.

Next, work with **custom content types** (e.g., “Blog Article” or “Press Release”). Add relevant fields and assign a **state flow** to control lifecycle and approval.  

_Suggestion:_ Explore entity details in CMP, create a new Content Type, and link a state flow to it.

![state flow](/images/2025/ch/ideation-state-flow.png)

---

## Content Hub DAM Configuration

Explore **default pages** such as *Assets*, *Create New Asset (Upload)*, *Create New Entity*, and *Asset Details*.

![custom asset details page](/images/2025/ch/pages-custom.png)

Duplicate and rebuild them to understand how **components** are structured and configured.  
Focus on the **Assets page** and its **Search component** — review options for filters, facets, pagination, and sorting.  
Also, check **CMP pages** to see how state flow is displayed and configured within components.

_Suggestion:_ Recreate pages from scratch to practice component setup and configuration.

---

## Project Management with MRM

In the **Marketing Resource Management (MRM)** module, understand how **projects**, **tasks**, and **jobs** are related.  

![sample project](/images/2025/ch/mrm-project.png)

Start by reviewing all available **roles** (Project Manager, Contributor, Reviewer) to see permission differences.  
Create a **test project**, add **tasks**, and assign them to users or roles. Compare how **tasks** differ from **jobs** in purpose and visibility.

_Suggestion:_ Review entity details to understand how jobs differ from projects.

---

## Security & Rights Management for Content Hub DAM

Experiment with **security rules and access conditions**.  

![security rules](/images/2025/ch/security-rules.png)

Create test users and assign them to different **user groups** to learn about default permissions and access scopes.  
Then, configure **policy combinations** using **“When All”** and **“When Any”** options — see how these combinations affect access to entities, pages, and assets.

## Bonus

Check these questions to test your readiness:

_Among these names which are types entity types or taxonomies? If it’s a taxonomy, what are the default values?_
```
M.Asset
M.AssetType
M.AssetMedia
M.File
M.Final.LifeCycle.Status
M.Project.Task
M.Project.Block
M.Content
M.Content.Repository
M.Automation.StateMachine
```


_What are the two main CMP State Flows? Which entities are they related to?_

_What is the default role every user should have in Content Hub DAM?_

_If you upload the same PNG twice, how many assets and files are created? Does Content Hub detect identical files?_

_What are the key differences between Taxonomy and Option List?_

_What is the purpose of the `Start state machine` action type?_

_What’s the difference between Multi-Stage Project, Basic Project, and Jobs?_

_Which component is used for Asset Search? How do you configure Result List, Facets, and Filters?_
